In the COE318 course, we delve into the software development lifecycle through a series of hands-on labs. 
These labs cover various stages, including requirements analysis, implementation using object-oriented programming, and rigorous testing and debugging. 
We work on decomposing problems into classes and modules, integrating these components, and ensuring the final product meets quality standards.
